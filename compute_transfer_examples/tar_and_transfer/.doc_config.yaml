title: 'Tar and Transfer Files with Compute'
short_description: |
    Use Globus Compute to bundle files into a tarball, which you then transfer
    using Globus Transfer.

    Two examples are included here, one in which the files are located on the
    server which runs Globus Compute, and one in which the files are on a user's
    machine and must be moved to the Compute host.
