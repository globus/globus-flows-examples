= Move (copy and delete) files

== Description

Perform a 'move' operation on a directory by first transferring from a source to a destination and then deleting from the source.
The entire directory's contents, including files and subdirectories, will be copied to the destination and then deleted from the source.

Globus-provided **flow** available in the Globus Web App.

The example is simplified and may exhibit slightly different behaviors.

== Highlights

In the example definition, the `IdentifyPathTypes` **state** uses expression evaluators to prepare several boolean values.

These boolean values are used by the `TestPathConstraints` **state** to conditionally modify the destination path used by the `Transfer` **state**.
